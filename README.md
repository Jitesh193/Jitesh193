Gratuated in Electrical Engineering at UNICAMP. Currently, I'm interning with RADAZ, working on Multisensory Inertial Navigation Algorithm Development (GNSS/INS), specifically focusing on algorithm optimizations that estimate parameters useful for inertial navigation.

Interested in data analysis, Artificial Intelligence and stochastic filtering, with a focus on Kalman Filters.
