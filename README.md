Electrical Engineering student at UNICAMP, concluding the last semester of the course. Currently, I'm interning with RADAZ, working on Multisensory Inertial Navigation Algorithm Development (GNSS/INS), specifically focusing on algorithm optimizations that estimate parameters useful for inertial navigation.
